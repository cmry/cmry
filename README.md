### 👋 Hi

I’m a Lecturer at the Department of [Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csai.nl) at Tilburg University, as well as a joint PhD student doing research [@tcsai](https://github.com/tcsai) and [@clips](https://github.com/clips/) under the supervision of [@gchrupala](https://github.com/gchrupala), [Walter Daelemans](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/) and [Eric Postma](https://ericpostma.nl/).

### ⚗️ Research 

I'm interested in the effect of intelligent systems on our lives. Systems that uncover our personal information, monitor and change our behavior, subtly restrict our exposure to information, and treat us unfairly. My current research focuses on the dual-use of computational stylometry; a field that aims to infer information from writing for good, proving harmfully invasive at the same time. My dissertation develops open-source tools to better understand, and defend against such techniques invading one's privacy.
