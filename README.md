### 👋 Hi

I’m a Researcher/Lecturer at the Department of [Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csai.nl) at Tilburg University.

### ⚗️ Research 

I'm interested in the effect of intelligent systems on our lives. Systems that uncover our personal information, monitor and change our behavior, subtly restrict our exposure to information, and treat us unfairly. My dissertation focused on the dual-use of computational stylometry; a field that aims to infer information from writing for good, proving harmfully invasive at the same time. I develop(ed) open-source tools to better understand, and defend against such techniques invading one's privacy.
