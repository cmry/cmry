### 👋 Hi

I’m a 👨🏼‍🏫 at Tilburg University, as well as a joint PhD 🎓 doing research for both the Department of [🧠 and 🤖](https://www.csai.nl) at Tilburg and CLiPS at the University of Antwerp under the supervision of [@gchrupala](https://github.com/gchrupala), [Walter Daelemans](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/) and [Eric Postma](https://ericpostma.nl/).

### ⚗️ Research 

I'm interested in the effect of intelligent systems (🧠 + 🤖) on our lives. Systems that uncover our personal information 🕵️, monitor and change our behavior 👁️, subtly restrict our exposure to information 🗨️, and treat us unfairly ✊. My current research focuses on the dual-use of computational stylometry ✍️; a field that aims to infer information from writing for good, proving harmfully invasive at the same time. My dissertation works toward developing open-source tools to better understand, and defend against such techniques invading one's privacy 🛡️.
